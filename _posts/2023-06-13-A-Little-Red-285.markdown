A little red sparrow    Sings a song of longing,    Fluttering its wings against the wind

In search of its freedom    It soars ever higher,     Across the sky of the unknown

The little red sparrow    Yearns for something greater,    Beyong the horizon and its fears

Its song reaching farther     Than ever before,    Gathering strength from this joyous quest
