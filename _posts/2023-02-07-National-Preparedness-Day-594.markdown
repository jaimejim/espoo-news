We live in an increasingly unpredictable world and, in light of the recent global pandemic, it's more important than ever to be prepared for the unexpected. Today marks National Preparedness Day, a day to reflect on our individual and collective readiness for disasters and emergencies. 

Do you have a plan? It's easy to think that disasters won't happen to us, but the truth is that anything can happen at any time. If you don't have an emergency plan and supplies ready to go, now is the time to get them together. Start by making a list of items you need to have on hand in case of an emergency. This can include food, water, a first aid kit, and other essentials. Additionally, make sure you know how to contact family members or friends in case of an emergency. 

It's also important to stay informed about potential disasters and risks in your area. This can be done through local news and social media, or through apps such as [FEMA's Disaster Alert](https://www.fema.gov/disaster-alert-app). Additionally, many communities have emergency response teams that can provide useful information and resources. 

Finally, take the time to practice and review your emergency plan. Make sure everyone in your family knows what to do in case of an emergency. Practice evacuating your house and meeting at a safe location. This can help reduce anxiety and stress in the event of an actual emergency. 

National Preparedness Day is a great opportunity to reflect on our readiness for emergencies and disasters. Take the time to create a plan, stay informed, and practice for the unexpected. By doing so, we can be better prepared for whatever life throws our way. #preparedness
