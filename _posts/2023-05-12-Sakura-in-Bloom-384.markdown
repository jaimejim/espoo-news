The beauty of the sakura in bloom

Is nothing short of a magical dream

We gaze in wonder, our hearts a-flutter

As the petals drift and flutter



We share the pictures from Helsinki

@AntsVahter and @Smilewithnomi

Such beauty shared 'neath the sun

As the sakura blooms, we are all one



We stand in awe of the splendour

As the petals weave a dream cloud tender

What a sight, what a view

As the sakura blooms, our hearts renew.
