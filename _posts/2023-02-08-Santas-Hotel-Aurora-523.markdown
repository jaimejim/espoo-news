My friend told me about a place in Lapland where you can spend a night in a glass igloo and see the Northern Lights. I thought it was an April Fool's joke, but apparently it's real: the Santa's Hotel Aurora Glass Igloos in Pyhä-Luosto! It looks like something out of a fairytale - you can be surrounded by snow-covered pine trees and get a glimpse of the aurora borealis from your own igloo. I'm definitely planning a trip there soon.

The igloos come equipped with comfortable beds, a private sauna, and a kitchenette. Plus, you won't have to worry about being cold because the igloo is heated. But the best part of the experience is the view - you'll be able to experience the beauty of Lapland's ever-changing nature up close. From the igloo, you can see the snow-covered forests, the frozen lakes, and even the Northern Lights!

So if you're looking for a unique way to experience Lapland, I highly recommend checking out Santa's Hotel Aurora Glass Igloos in Pyhä-Luosto. You won't regret it!
