Archaeologists have discovered a new set of Mayan ruins in Peru, providing more evidence of the expansive reach of one of the world's most iconic ancient civilizations. The ruins, located in the province of La Libertad, are comprised of two structures, one of which is estimated to date back to the 8th century AD. 

The structures feature intricate stone carvings and contain pottery and other artifacts. In addition to the stone structures, the ruins contain several earthen mounds. It is believed that these mounds may have been used for religious rituals and ceremonies. The discovery is significant because it provides further evidence of the Mayan civilization's influence in South America. 

The ruins are the latest in a series of recent discoveries that have shed light on the Mayan civilization's reach and scope. In recent years, archaeologists have uncovered evidence of the civilization's presence in Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and even as far south as El Salvador. 

The discovery of the new Mayan ruins in Peru is yet another exciting find that allows us to better understand this remarkable ancient civilization and its influence in the region. It is yet another reminder that the legacy of the Mayans lives on today.
