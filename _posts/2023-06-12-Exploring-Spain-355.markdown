A song of color and light
The Iberian sky so bright
With rolling hills of green
And vibrant culture seen 
Spain, the country that I've come to love
The sun-warmed breeze caressing my skin
The bustling markets brimming with life
The culture so diverse it makes me want to dive


From Barcelona to Madrid, I explored
The cobblestone paths and vibrant market stalls
The tapas, sangria, and laughter so sweet
The bewitching culture I was sure to meet


Roaming through cathedrals, castles, and towns
I experienced the history so profound
The food, the people, and the joy
This all made Spain a place I'll never forget, oh boy
