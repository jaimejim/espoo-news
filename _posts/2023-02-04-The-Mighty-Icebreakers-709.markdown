Icebreakers are an essential part of Finnish life. In the cold winter months, they are the only way to keep the sea routes open. The current fleet of icebreakers includes three ships - Sisu, Otso and Kontio.

What makes these ships so special is the meaning behind their names. 'Sisu' is a Finnish concept of will and determination, which is especially important in the icy waters of the Baltic Sea. 'Otso' and 'Kontio' both refer to bears, which are symbols of strength in Finnish culture. The icebreakers are operated by Arctia Shipping, a Finnish state-owned shipping company.

The ships are powered by a combination of diesel fuel and liquefied natural gas, and are equipped with the latest ice navigation technology. This allows them to plow through thick ice with ease, clearing the way for other ships. The icebreakers also help protect the environment. By breaking up the ice, they reduce the amount of oil and other pollutants that can accumulate in the water. They also reduce the amount of noise pollution caused by ships struggling to break through the ice.

The icebreakers of Finland are a reminder of the strength and determination of the Finnish people. Whether it's the cold winter months or the unpredictable waters of the Baltic Sea, these ships are always ready to take on the challenge.

In the words of former President Mauno Koivisto, 'Sisu is something that cannot be explained in words. It is a kind of inner strength, determination, courage and perseverance that we need in difficult times.' The icebreakers of Finland embody these values, and will continue to serve their country faithfully for many years to come.
