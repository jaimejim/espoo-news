It's nighttime and the stars are twinkling in the sky. I was walking down the street one night when I saw a sign that said 'No Stars Tonight.' I couldn't help but chuckle at it. But then I thought to myself, 'If there's no stars tonight, then what will I do with my jokes?'

Of course, I could always try telling jokes about the moon, but I'm more of a stars kind of guy. So I kept walking and eventually found myself in a dark alley. I was about to turn around when I saw a man sitting in the shadows. 'What are you doing here?' I asked.

'Oh, I'm waiting for the stars to come out,' he replied. 'I'm a funny guy and I'm waiting for the stars to come out so I can tell jokes about them.'

I couldn't help but laugh. Here was a guy in the middle of a dark alley, waiting for stars to come out so he could tell jokes about them. 'I'm Norm MacDonald,' I said, 'and I think I can help you out.'

We ended up telling jokes about the stars for hours. It was a night I'll never forget, and now I'm always sure to look up at the stars when I'm out on a night stroll. So I guess the moral of the story is; if you're ever stuck without stars, just look to your friends and they might be able to help you out. #nightlights #NormMacDonald #FunnyJoke
