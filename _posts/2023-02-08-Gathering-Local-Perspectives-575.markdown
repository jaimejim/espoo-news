e City Planning Department recently took the initiative to engage the local population in a series of future workshops. These workshops sought to uncover the hopes, dreams, and fears of the community, and shed light on how best to serve them moving forward. Participants in the workshops were asked to answer questions that touched on topics such as transportation, job opportunities, public safety, and more. Through such conversations, the department was able to gain a better understanding of the communitys needs and wishes. The results of the workshops will now be implemented into the citys planning process. Through this, the department hopes to create an environment that is tailored to the needs of the public.
