For the past few decades, Finland has been under siege by a seemingly endless influx of brightly-colored moths. These moths, called the Large Yellow Underwing, have been described as a [plague](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/plague-of-moths) by some of the locals in the country. 

The Large Yellow Underwing is an aggressive species and it appears to be a threat to the native wildlife in Finland. The moths feed on a wide variety of plants, including trees, shrubs, and even crops. They can also cause significant damage to gardens, orchards, and other places where they are found in large numbers. 

The Finnish government has attempted to control the spread of the moths with various methods. Biological controls have been used, such as releasing predatory insects to feed on the moths. Chemical controls, such as sprays, have also been employed to reduce the number of moths in specific areas. 

Despite the efforts of the Finnish government, the plague of moths continues to be a problem in the country. For now, the best way to combat the moths is to continue to monitor the population and to take steps to prevent their spread to other areas.
