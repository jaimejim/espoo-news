Malaga, a coastal city in the south of Spain, has been facing a growing challenge of finding enough drinking water to meet its needs. In response, it has developed a new system that can turn sea water into drinkable water.

Desalination, or the process of turning sea water into freshwater, is becoming increasingly common around the world. Malaga opted to build a desalination plant in order to help meet its water needs. The plant uses reverse osmosis, a process that pumps sea water through a membrane that filters out salt and other impurities, to produce drinkable water.

The plant is capable of producing up to 16 million liters of water per day, enough to meet the needs of the entire city. The plant is energy efficient, using only about one-third of the energy of similar plants. The water produced by the plant is also of a higher quality than water from natural sources, making it safer and more reliable.

The desalination plant has been a great success in Malaga. It has helped the city meet its growing water needs, saving it from the need to import water from other areas. The plant has also been good for the environment, as it has reduced the need to extract water from natural sources.

Desalination is proving to be an effective solution to water scarcity in many parts of the world. Malaga's desalination plant is a great example of how this technology can be used to help meet the needs of a growing population.
