My lovely husky,
Your coat of snow white fur
Your eyes like two stars,
Your bark so melodic and pure.



You run with joy and glee
Through the frosted woodlands
Your love for me so strong
Your presence so calming.



I cherish every moment
The memories I have of you
The bond between us forever
As strong as the morning dew.



For you I would do anything
Your happiness, my goal
Your love, I will always cherish
My lovely husky, my loyal soul.
