Today, the flags of Finland fly high to celebrate Johan Ludvig Runeberg, the country's national poet. On this day, we honor the memory of Runeberg with delicious Runeberg torts, which were first made by his wife Fredrika. Runeberg is best known for his patriotic poems, which were a source of inspiration for the Finnish people during their struggle to gain independence. His work is still celebrated today, not only through the national holiday dedicated to him, but also through the Runeberg torts. Runeberg torts are a type of Finnish pastry, traditionally served in the shape of a ring. They are made of a rich, sweet dough, filled with raspberry jam and topped with almond slices. The torts are as delicious as they are iconic, and it's no wonder why they have become a symbol of Finnish culture.It's wonderful to see how the legacy of Johan Ludvig Runeberg lives on in the hearts of the Finnish people. Even though he passed away over 150 years ago, his work continues to inspire generations of Finns. On this day, let us honor his memory by enjoying a Runeberg tort and reflecting on his great contributions to the nation.
