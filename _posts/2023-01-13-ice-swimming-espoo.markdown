Espoo, Finland is known for its cold temperatures, particularly during the winter months. Despite the harsh weather, many Finns engage in ice swimming, which involves diving into a hole in the ice and swimming in the frigid water. This activity is beloved by many for its health benefits and the adrenaline rush it provides. Swimming in cold water has been shown to increase circulation and boost the immune system. Additionally, the sudden shock of the cold water can provide an invigorating and energizing experience.

Ice swimming is a popular tradition in Finland, where many lakes and ponds freeze over in the winter. Despite the cold, people will strip down to their swimwear and take a quick dip in the ice-cold water. Some even participate in organized events, such as races and competitions, to see who can swim the farthest or the longest.

The city of [Espoo provides some suggestions](https://www.espoo.fi/en/sports-and-nature/outdoor-exercise-facilities/winter-swimming-place) on where to go ice swimming. In total there are nine winter swimming venues provided by Sports Services, all of which are maintained by clubs and associations.

Many of these places do have a heated changing room that is divided by a curtain into a male and a female side. Entrance/exit via the door on your own side with no sauna or showers.

### I can do it, so you can too

If you think you can't, I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them.

Seriously though, ice swimming can be a frightening experience for many people due to the freezing temperature of the water and the potential risk of hypothermia. The sudden shock to the body can also cause physical discomfort and mental stress. Additionally, there is a risk of falling through the ice and becoming trapped underwater. It is important to take precautions and follow safety guidelines before attempting ice swimming.

But fear not, for there are tools that can help. For example the [Lumi ice-swimming bag](https://lumiaccessories.com/product/eira-ice-swimmer-bag/)
. Originally created for the ice-swimming community and practice in Eiranranta, Helsinki. It has a fully detachable and foldable padded mat to step on, to protect against rocks, ice and snow.

On top of that I would recommend ice shoes, gloves and a hat so that the heat does not scape. Remember that ice baths have been touted for various health benefits including:

- Reducing inflammation: Cold water immersion can decrease muscle soreness and swelling caused by intense physical activity.
- Boosting Immunity: Cold water exposure can stimulate the immune system and help improve overall health.
- Improving circulation: The alternating hot-cold temperatures of an ice bath can improve blood flow and oxygenation.
- Enhancing recovery: Soaking in an ice bath after physical activity can help reduce muscle damage and speed up recovery time.
- Relieving stress: Cold water immersion can release endorphins, which are natural mood boosters.
