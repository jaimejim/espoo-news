Pink skies over Lapland are a sight to behold. The majestic Aurora Borealis, or Northern Lights, can be seen dancing in the night sky, creating a beautiful and surreal display of colors. The phenomenon is caused by the interaction of solar wind and the Earth's magnetic field, producing a spectacular show of greens, blues, purples, and pinks.

The beauty of the Aurora Borealis is best appreciated when viewed with the moon in the sky. The moonlight provides a backdrop for the vibrant colors of the Northern Lights, while also adding a sense of mystery and wonder to the already breathtaking sight. The combination of the moonlight and the Aurora Borealis creates a truly magical experience, one that will stay with you long after the lights have faded.

However, the Aurora Borealis can also be enjoyed without the moon. The night sky is still filled with a dazzling display of colors, and the experience can be just as breathtaking. Without the moon, the Aurora Borealis is more subtle and mysterious, providing a unique and tranquil experience.

No matter which way you choose to enjoy the Aurora Borealis, it is sure to be an unforgettable experience. The majestic beauty of the Northern Lights is something that everyone should experience at least once in their lifetime, and Lapland is the perfect place to do so. So grab your coat and head out to Lapland to witness the beauty of the pink skies over Lapland. }
