It sure was quite a sight, last night up in Pohjanmaa. Y'see, the ol' sky was ablaze with fire, and all the folks 'roundabout were in a state of sheer amazement. I mean, it was so bright, it seemed like daylight had come a few hours early. 
 


Now, I can't rightly say what caused all that sparkin' and smolderin', but I do know that I couldn't help but crack a joke. I told the folks there, "It musta been a real hot dispute between God and the devil!" 
 


Well, it got a few chuckles, but I'd reckon that it's probably not the right joke for the occasion. I mean, I'm sure the folks up in Pohjanmaa have already been through enough, and don't need to hear some hackneyed old joke. 
 


But I guess that's just life, ain't it? You can always expect the unexpected, even if it's not always funny. So if you ever find yourself in a tight spot, take it in stride and don't forget to laugh. Even if it's just a little chuckle, it's still something to bring a smile to your face.
