I recently had the pleasure of visiting Nuuksio National Park in Espoo, Finland. The park is renowned for its lush forests, diverse wildlife, and, of course, its emblem species: the elusive Flying Squirrel.

I was unaware of the flying squirrel's presence in the park until my guide, Jukka Risikko, shared a photo of one perched on a branch. I was immediately intrigued and eager to explore the park in search of this fascinating creature.

We set out early in the morning, binoculars in hand, and soon found ourselves in the heart of Nuuksio. Everywhere we looked, there were signs of life. We spotted a variety of birds and mammals, from red squirrels to black woodpeckers.

As the sun rose higher in the sky, Jukka pointed to a tree in the distance. There, perched on a branch, was the object of our quest: a Flying Squirrel. We watched, mesmerized, as the squirrel leapt from branch to branch. It was a magical moment that I won't soon forget.

If you ever find yourself in the Espoo area, I highly recommend a visit to Nuuksio National Park. While you may not get the chance to spot a Flying Squirrel, you'll be sure to find plenty of other interesting wildlife and beautiful scenery to enjoy.
