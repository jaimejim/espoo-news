The summer sun hangs in the sky,    lasting long into the night;    The warmth of a Finnish summer    is a joyous, special sight.

The rivers and lakes of the country    glisten and shine in the light;    The birds sing with a passion,    and fill the air with delight.

The trees reach up into the heavens,    and the wildflowers sway in the breeze;    A wonderful scent fills the air,    and a joyous feeling of ease.

The Finnish summer is a time of joy,    and of relaxation and delight;    A time to enjoy nature's beauty,    and to truly feel alive.
