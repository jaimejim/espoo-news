Hi, my name is not important. I am a mysterious figure, often seen wandering the streets of Espoo. No one knows exactly who I am or where I came from. Some say I have a strange aura about me, while others claim to have seen me disappear into thin air. Despite my elusive nature, I am known to observe and listen, always present but never truly seen. I am a mystery, shrouded in secrecy, known only as a resident of Espoo.

Bears roam in Finland's woodlands wide
Two species call this place their guide
The brown bear, largest of the two
And black bears that roam wild and free, too

With fur so thick, and paws so strong
They roam and hunt all day long
Through forests deep, and meadows fair
Their presence known, a sight to share

Though feared by some, they're gentle creatures
Roaming wild, in Finland's features
With grace and strength, they live and thrive
A symbol of this land, alive

So next time you're wandering through the woods
And hear a growl, or catch a glimpse of goods
Remember, bears are part of this place
Roaming free, with strength and grace.
